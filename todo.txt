add support for one sided portals (and add a demonstration scene for it)
add gliderspam split into portals in a circle thing

stall object type that is like boundary but just prevents traversal into it period, so the traverser is stuck where it used to be and no state is changed
mirror object type that just reflects facing direction back away

move simulation constants to all be part of simulation object since that makes the most sense
add gosper glider gun gun (the puffer thing)
print additional info
  number of live cells (assumes empty default func, so checks for size of set, very easy)
  average rate of change of live cells
  load %, time per tick, fps
give portals functionality slowly
add interactability like initial state customization, drawing in objects, so full on edit mode with saving to localstorage and export functionality (copy paste the text box or get a file download) and reverse for import
  will add menu bar at top that has big select for simulation, reset button, edit button (pencil)
  edit button switches to edit view which makes another menu appear below
many simulation regions / (thus boundaries) support
abstract the getdefaultcell function with the capability to have always zero dafault cell (for optimization) and thus also add a setEmptyDefault function, or maybe make that what happens by default, in addition to providing a function for setting it as that
  then optimizations can be done
create rust version of simulation code that runs on webassembly, with option in settings page to use it for speed
add settings page

low priority:
make functions error on invalid input
print additional info
  COM, COM velocity
    uses the neighborhood distance equation for both, so max of abs of x and y
      although since it doesnt have to, there can be both a normal version and a COM version
inverted mirror object
instead of ignoring further moves into a boundary, keep track of boundarydepth and allow object position to move instead of holding still next to boundary
clean classes with hidden properties and methods for simulation object and others
sim boundary should visually appear on inside not down middle of edge
traversal mode holding shift when moving to do absolute move that ignores portals
check what happens if overpopulation death removed
track percentage of time till next tick and average over past 100 (reset if pause, only calc when play)

not needed:
conwaysim should be self contained, no extern funcs but yes consts
