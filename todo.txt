stall object type that is like boundary but just prevents traversal into it period, so the traverser is stuck where it used to be and no state is changed
mirror object type that just reflects facing direction back away

move simulation constants to all be part of simulation object since that makes the most sense
add gosper glider gun gun (the puffer thing)
print additional info
  number of live cells (assumes empty default func, so checks for size of set, very easy)
  average rate of change of live cells
  load %, time per tick, fps
give portals functionality slowly
add interactability like initial state customization, drawing in objects, so full on edit mode with saving to localstorage and export functionality (copy paste the text box or get a file download) and reverse for import
  will add menu bar at top that has big select for simulation, reset button, edit button (pencil)
  edit button switches to edit view which makes another menu appear below

low priority:
make functions error on invalid input
print additional info
  COM, COM velocity
    uses the neighborhood distance equation for both, so max of abs of x and y
      although since it doesnt have to, there can be both a normal version and a COM version
inverted mirror object
instead of ignoring further moves into a boundary, keep track of boundarydepth and allow object position to move instead of holding still next to boundary
